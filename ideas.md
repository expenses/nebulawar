jump drives charge faster

a lot of different jump locations, can have ships in any
have a set number of civilians, can convert them into fighter squads and engineering squads etc

engineering squads need resources to do repairs/upgrades

ships have various parts, parts have an age modifier which determines breakdown chance but do not otherwise get worse with age

fighters cant jump (unless upgraded)

various sources of resources, planets, asteroids, abandoned space stations

various random events

warp was created by a dead race, kinda spooky graveyard
